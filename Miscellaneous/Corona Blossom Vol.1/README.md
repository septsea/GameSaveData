You can click [this link](https://vndb.org/v19125) to get more information about the game.

This applies to the English versions (well, here are 3 volumes):

- [Corona Blossom Vol.1: Gift From the Galaxy](https://vndb.org/r47267)
- [Corona Blossom Vol.2: The Truth From Beyond](https://vndb.org/r73503)
- [Corona Blossom Vol.3: Journey To The Stars](https://vndb.org/r73504)

*The 3 games are very simple (two of which even have no options to choose at all), so I do not provide walkthroughs here. ~~If you are here for H scenes, you could just apply save data, right? I know there are many people asking for guides before launching games. I disagree. However, as was once said by Hegel, what is rational is actual and what is actual is rational. Hence that is why I create this repository.~~*

On the page you can see a zip file `corona.zip`. After downloading and extracting it, you will see three folders:

- `Corona Blossom vol.1`
- `Corona Blossom vol.2`
- `Corona Blossom vol.3`

Open the folder `C:\Users\<YOUR USER NAME>\AppData\Roaming\Frontwing` (**Folder F**). Back up the folders `Corona Blossom vol.*` if necessary. Now, copy the three folders to **Folder F**. Launch the game. It should take effect.

Enjoy yourself!

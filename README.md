# Game Save Data

Welcome to my repository!

This repository stores save data of some games.

It helps a lot if you do not want to walk through the game.

I mainly play two kinds of games: the uncensored and the yuri games.

There are three folders. Suppose there is a game X whose save data the repository has. The following pseudocode tells you how I organize the save data. (Sometimes there are exceptions, though. `elif` means `else if`.)

```text
if (X is a yuri game):
    save data of X are in the folder `Yuri`
elif (X is an uncensored game):
    save data of X are in the folder `Uncensored`
else:
    save data of X are in the folder `Miscellaneous`
```

If there is anything wrong, just raise an issue.

Most walkthroughs are from https://seiya-saiga.com/game/kouryaku.html and http://www.otakulair.com/english-visual-novel-walkthroughs/. Anyway, I ensure that every game in the above list has an English walkthrough, unless I explicitly state exceptions.

~~I also put a `magnet.json` file for your reference.~~

Enjoy yourself!

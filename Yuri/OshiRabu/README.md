You can click [this link](https://vndb.org/v27236) to get more information about the game.

This applies to [the English version](https://vndb.org/r71603).

Here is a walkthrough (very easy):

```text
# Start the game
...I'm sorry for lying.                        # or "Are you really sorry?"

Bad End:
    # Save 01
    So I didn't say a word.

True End:
    # Load Save 01
    But I wanted to stop her tears.
    # Save 02
    I want to see Ren.

Happy End:
    # Load save 02
    I don't want to hurt her anymore.

# If you want to collect all CGs, do not forget "EX SCENARIO" on the title screen.
```

On the page you can see a zip file `oshirabu.zip`. After downloading and extracting it, you will see one file:

- `BGI.gdb`

Quit the game. Open the game folder (which contains `OSHIRABU.exe`). Back up the original `BGI.gdb` if necessary. Now, just copy the file `BGI.gdb` to the folder. Launch the game. It should take effect.

Enjoy yourself!

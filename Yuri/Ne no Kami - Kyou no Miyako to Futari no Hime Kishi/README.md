You can click [this link](https://vndb.org/v17588) to get more information about the game.

This applies to [the English version](https://vndb.org/r44308).

No walkthrough is needed. Just read it.

On the page you can see a zip file `nenokami.zip`. After downloading and extracting it, you will see one file:

- `saveg.dat`

Quit the game. Open the game folder (which contains `Nenokami_KyouHime_P1.exe`). Back up the folder `savedata` if necessary. Now, just copy the file `saveg.dat` to the folder `savedata`. Launch the game. It should take effect.

Enjoy yourself!

Here is a walkthrough (very easy):

Ichika:
    True end:
        ...even though we're twins, we can't be together forever, can we?
        ...and she's right, this is for Futaba's own good. I have to be strong.
        ...try to catch her.
        ...refuse to help.
        # Save 01
        I should just grab onto her like always.
        Go look for Ichika.
        # Save 02
        Don't call out to her.
        ...keep watching her.
        I think it was like this...
        Maybe she didn't appreciate it.
        ...listen through the door.
        # Save 03
        I know others won't approve, but still, I...
    Bad end:
        # Load save 03
        I just can't imagine parting ways with Futaba!
Futaba:
    True end:
        # Load save 02
        Call out to her.
        ...stop Futaba.
        W-wait, what am I thinking?!
        Even so, I don't regret it.
        ...peek!
        # Save 04
        These feelings are wrong, aren't they?
    Bad end:
        # Load save 04
        I can't let things continue like this...
CG Recollection:
    # Load save 01
    I should sneak up from behind and hug her.
    """ When you reach "But during the following periods, the way Ichika
    had spoken to me wouldn't leave my mind." you can quit the game. """
```

On the page you can see a zip file `sisterly.zip`. After downloading and extracting it, you will see one file:

- `persistent`

This is a Ren'py game, so you have extra work to do. First, quit the game, as usual.

Open the game folder (which contains `SisterlyBliss.exe`). Back up the folder `game/saves` if necessary. Now, just copy the file `persistent` to the folder `saves`.

Wait! Go to `C:\Users\<YOUR USER NAME>\AppData\Roaming\MangaGamer`. Back up the folder `Sisterly Bliss` if you want to. Remove (or rename) it. Launch the game. It should take effect.

Enjoy yourself!

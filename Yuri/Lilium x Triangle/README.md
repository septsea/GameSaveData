You can click [this link](https://vndb.org/v13839) to get more information about the game.

This applies to [the English version](https://vndb.org/r62217).

Here is a walkthrough (very easy):

```text
Yunna:
    # Start the game
    # It does not take much time to reach the first option, so no save slot is needed.
    Go to Yunna's Classroom.
    Yuuna's Bedroom.
    I wish Yunna was my bride.
    I think I understand Yunna's feeling about you.

Sana:
    # Start the game
    Go to Sana's Classroom.
    Sana's Bedroom.
    Yunna is a good older sister.
    You're more than the big sister type.

# If you wish to collect all CGs, go on.
Harem 1 (no H scene):
    # Start the game
    Go to Yunna's Classroom.
    Sana's Bedroom.
    I wish Yunna was my bride.
    You're more than the big sister type.

# Well, if you still want to explore the game, here is another harem route.
Harem 2 (the same as 1):
    # Start the game
    Go to Sana's Classroom.
    Yuuna's Bedroom.
    Yunna is a good older sister.
    I think I understand Yunna's feeling about you.

On the page you can see a zip file `lilium.zip`. After downloading and extracting it, you will see one file:

- `syssave.dat`

Quit the game. Open the game folder (which contains `Lilium.exe`). Back up the folder `save` if necessary. Now, just copy the file `syssave.dat` to the folder `save`. Launch the game. It should take effect.

Enjoy yourself!

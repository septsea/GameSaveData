![Ne no Kami - Kyou no Miyako to Futari no Hime Kishi Part 2](https://s2.vndb.org/cv/58/31158.jpg)

You can click [this link](https://vndb.org/v18849) to get more information about the game.

This applies to [the English version](https://vndb.org/r46475).

No walkthrough is needed. There are only 2 choices (hence only 2 routes). Just read it.

On the page you can see a zip file `nenokami2.zip`. After downloading and extracting it, you will see one file:

- `saveg.dat`

Quit the game. Open the folder `C:\Users\<YOUR USER NAME>\AppData\Roaming\kuroirodoruyomiji`. Back up the folder `nenokami2` if necessary. Now, just copy the file `saveg.dat` to the folder `nenokami2`. Launch the game. It should take effect.

Enjoy yourself!

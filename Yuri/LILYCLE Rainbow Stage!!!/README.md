You can click [this link](https://vndb.org/v18057) to get more information about the game.

This applies to [the English version](https://vndb.org/r57771).

On the page you can see a zip file `lilycle.zip`. After downloading and extracting it, you will see one file:

- `syssave.dat`

Quit the game. Open the game folder (which contains `LYRSADV.exe`). Back up the folder `save` if necessary. Now, just copy the file `syssave.dat` to the folder `save`. Launch the game. It should take effect.

Here is a walkthrough (it is long, so I put it here; you do not really need a walkthrough; believe me):

You can click [this link](https://vndb.org/v18131) to get more information about the game.

This applies to the English version (well, I am confused this time; I play the demosaic/uncensored game, but there seems no standalone demosaic edition; anyway, you can get a free copy).

Here is a walkthrough (***easier than easier***):

```text
"""
You do not need any walkthrough for this game.
You could click "Start Story" -> "H-scene Menu".
Then the game asks you "Unlock all H-Scenes?", and you click "Yes".
Now you can click "System Config" -> "Scene Sel." to watch every route.
(You can also skip it, if you enable "Skip unread text" and "Show scene seek bar".
`Ctrl` can also skip text.)
If you are too lazy to skip all the scenes, just apply my save data.
Well, nobody is lazy, or everyone is lazy.

```

On the page you can see a zip file `maitetsu.zip`. After downloading and extracting it, you will see one file:

- `datasu.ksd`

Quit the game. Open the game folder (which contains `Maitetsu.exe`). Back up the folder `savedata` if necessary. Now, just copy the file `datasu.ksd` to the folder `savedata`. Launch the game. It should take effect.

Enjoy yourself!

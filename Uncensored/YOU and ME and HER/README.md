![YOU and ME and HER: a love story](https://s2.vndb.org/cv/27/15927.jpg)

You can click [this link](https://vndb.org/v7738) to get more information about the game.

This applies to [the English version](https://vndb.org/r71491).

The `Key` (in the game manual) is `29197057`. If your `Key` is the same, applying external save data should work. If not, you may still have a try to see whether it works.

[Here is a walkthrough.](http://www.otakulair.com/english-visual-novel-walkthroughs/you-and-me-and-her-a-love-story-walkthrough-nitroplus-jast-usa/)

On the page you can see a zip file `totono.zip`. After downloading and extracting it, you will see three folders:

- `totono.Aoi`: the Aoi end. You can enjoy all the Aoi CGs and scenes.
- `totono.BeforeDeletingData`: the save data just before the game's deletion (see the walkthrough for details). Load the first save slot and you will be directed to "3 â€“ After reboot" (in the walkthrough).
- `totono.Miyuki`: the Miyuki end. You can enjoy all the Miyuki CGs and scenes.

Quit the game. Open the folder `C:\Users\<YOUR USER NAME>\AppData\Roaming\Nitroplus` (**Folder N**). Back up the original folder `totono` if necessary. Pick one folder (say, `totono.XXX`) and copy it to **Folder N**. Rename `totono.XXX` to `totono`. Launch the game. It should take effect.

Last but not least, here is the set of random questions (with options!) for convenience.

You can click [this link](https://vndb.org/v21458) to get more information about the game.

This applies to the English version ([the all-ages edition](https://vndb.org/r52415), with [the uncensored patch](https://vndb.org/r54691)).

Here is a walkthrough (you do not need it, in fact; at most 2\*2\*2=8 possibilities, after all):

Keep watching Alice
# The Sweet Route end
# Load save 01
Follow my instincts
# The Spicy Route end
```

On the page you can see a zip file `moroclo.zip`. After downloading and extracting it, you will see three folders:

- `moroclo`

Open the folder `C:\Users\<YOUR USER NAME>\AppData\Roaming\Frontwing` (**Folder F**). Back up the folder `moroclo` if necessary. Now, copy the folder to **Folder F**. Launch the game. It should take effect.

Enjoy yourself!

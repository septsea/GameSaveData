Here is a walkthrough (very easy):

# Start the game
""" Bro (most people who would like to play the game are male, right?), just
enjoy the long story before making the 1st choice. If you just want to enjoy
H scenes, I suggest you consider SkyFish games, some of which are "Nyan Cafe
Macchiato", "WanNyan a la Mode!", "Imouto Paradises!", "Imouto Paradises! 2"
and "Imouto Paradises! 3". """
Gently talk her down
What would you do if I asked?
Ask bluntly
Did something happen between you two?
Talk to her about it
Let's just watch and see.
You really know everything, don't you?

# Save 01
I want to fly alongside the A6M5 Zero.
# The Hikari end
# By the way, I am unable to skip the ending movie.

# Load save 01
I want to fly alongside the Ki-44 Shouki.
# The Kazusa end
# Well, I still have to watch the ending movie.

# Load save 01
I want to fly alongside the Spitfire LF Mk. IXc.
# The Mimari end
# ... Why can I not skip it?!

# Load save 01
I want to fly alongside the Ki-46 III Otsu + Hei.
# The Nahoko end
# The game is finally over.
```

On the page you can see a zip file `underonewing.zip`. After downloading and extracting it, you will see one file:

- `datasu.ksd`

Quit the game. Open the game folder (which contains `UnderOneWing.exe`). Back up the folder `savedata` if necessary. Now, just copy the file `datasu.ksd` to the folder `savedata`. Launch the game. It should take effect.

Enjoy yourself!

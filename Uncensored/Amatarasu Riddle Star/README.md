You can click [this link](https://vndb.org/v12992) to get more information about the game.

This applies to [the English version](https://vndb.org/r56270).

On the page you can see a zip file `amatarasu.zip`. After downloading and extracting it, you will see one folder (*You wonder why it is not a single file `persistent`? You will know why after seeing the walkthrough*):

- `saves`

This is a Ren'py game, so you have extra work to do. First, quit the game, as usual.

Open the game folder (which contains `AmatarasuRiddleStar.exe`). Back up the folder `game/saves` if necessary. Now, just copy the file `persistent` to the folder ``.

Wait! Go to `C:\Users\<YOUR USER NAME>\AppData\RenPy`. Back up the folder `AmatarasuRiddleStar` if you want to. Remove (or rename) it. Launch the game. It should take effect.

Here is a walkthrough:
